    talk-title: Unleash the Chaos
    talk-abstract: <p>Throughout the history dating back before the Middle Ages, Chaos has led to important technical and social innovations. And, it turns out, introducing a selected level of Chaos into your organization is a proven way to increase the rate and success of innovative problem solving and product designs. Why is this so? And how can you take advantage of this important "superpower" of consistently innovative companies?</p><p>Based on the work of Ori Brafman and others, this talk shows examples of three key traits of innovative cultures including "Whitespace", "The Unusual Suspects", and "Organized Serendipity" and provides guidance on how you can encourage these traits in your own team or company.</p>

    talk-title: How Low Can You Go? Reducing Costs and Development Time with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Elastic Beanstalk, and 3scale (and don't forget Swagger!)
    talk-abstract: <p>More than 18,000 developers have keys to the Wordnik API, which they use to build everything from edtech applications to word games to Twitterbots! Our original architecture has served more than 2bn calls since 2010, and has largely been a free service.</p><p>When Wordnik relaunched as a nonprofit in late 2014, we realized we had to monetize our API to create a sustainable foundation for future development, and in order to monetize, we needed to reduce our operating costs and introduce new features -- neither of which our previous architecture made simple.</p><p>Enter AWS Lambda+API Gateway! By breaking down our current API into tiny functions, we can take advantage of the current microservice craze with minimal ops headaches. And by using Elastic Beanstalk and 3Scale to manage a reverse proxy, handling routing between the old and new API calls and managing billing is much easier, too. Add a pretty Swagger interface on top and you''re good to go ... faster and cheaper!</p>

    talk-abstract: <p>More than 18,000 developers have keys to the Wordnik API, which they use to build everything from edtech applications to word games to Twitterbots! Our original architecture has served more than 2bn calls since 2010, and has largely been a free service.</p><p>When Wordnik relaunched as a nonprofit in late 2014, we realized we had to monetize our API to create a sustainable foundation for future development, and in order to monetize, we needed to reduce our operating costs and introduce new features -- neither of which our previous architecture made simple.</p><p>Enter AWS Lambda+API Gateway! By breaking down our current API into tiny functions, we can take advantage of the current microservice craze with minimal ops headaches. And by using Elastic Beanstalk and 3Scale to manage a reverse proxy, handling routing between the old and new API calls and managing billing is much easier, too. Add a pretty Swagger interface on top and you''re good to go ... faster and cheaper!</p>

    talk-title: Hypermedia vs Graphs&#58; Best buddies or the next API battleground?
    talk-abstract: <p>We all wonder if this is the year that hypermedia becomes mainstream? But coming up on the rails, there is a new challenger&#58; Graph-shaped APIs that predefine a wide network of relationships promise some of the benefits of hypermedia APIs, but present a more familiar programming model. Will graphs push aside hypermedia before it's even had a chance, or will both styles play nicely? Is this trend a blocker to HATEOS nirvana or a stepping stone?</p><p>I'll challenge the audience to consider combining these two approaches to open the door to mainstream hypermedia use, enriching a fixed graph with dynamic data and behavior. Volatile data and logic can use hypermedia and more foundational data can use graph approaches. In this way we can add value and depth to our apps without the drastic rewrites we so often expect from the transition to hypermedia.</p>

    talk-title: The end of polling&#58; why and how to transform a REST API into a Data Streaming API.
    talk-abstract: <p>IoT & Mobile, User eXperience, Interactivity and RESTful APIs...those topics are big trends in development today. The last one brings fast adoption and reduced development costs but is in opposition with the three others needs. IoT & Mobile need low latency whereas UX and interactivity need real-time data to keep user interest alive. As a developer you need to poll APIs to provide these real-time information, with all the limitations that this involves. On the other side as an API provider, being massively polled can become an issue and you're probably looking for a more resilient solution to offer to your consumer. What if we can apply the "Hollywood principle" to REST APIs? Don't poll us, we will push you! And why not going further by reducing the amount of data to transfer? In this talk, we'll see together which technology you should opt for and how to implement them to turn your API into a Data Streaming API.</p>

    talk-title: Creating a Great Developer Experience Through SDKs
    talk-abstract: <p>Many of us know it can be difficult to maintain SDKs for an API; meanwhile, developers keep asking for them. So how do we ensure a great developer experience while working on decreasing the pains of maintaining SDKs? In this talk, we will explore how we can create a great developer experience through our SDKs with strategies like using data to make informed SDK decisions, defining community and product SDKs more clearly, determining when to treat SDKs as products, and much more. We will also look at examples of existing SDKs to learn documentation tips and tricks and what common pitfalls to avoid. The landscape of who is using our APIs is changing, and SDKs can be helpful for many new API users. So, let's learn how to use SDKs to maximize developer adoption while making sure they don't become a headache.</p>

    talk-title: Using Hypermedia APIs to Drive Interactive Mobile Applications
    talk-abstract: <p>At Comcast, the backbone of cross-platform Xfinity TV experience is a hypermedia API supporting both XHTML and HAL as media types. It's given us several expected benefits&#58; self-documentation, loose coupling, and discoverability. At the same time, it also uncovered some limitations of hypermedia.</p><p>Hypermedia is designed so that the API works very similarly to a traditional web site&mdash;load a resource, follow a link, and then load the next resource. Modern, native mobile apps, on the other hand, try very hard to not present a page-oriented, wait and load experience. Users expect their apps to be responsive, fast, and not beholden to a page-like paradigm.</p><p>In this presentation, Benjamin will discuss the design of our hypermedia API and demonstrate some of the strategies we''ve come up with to address these concerns. We'll use different examples from our API to illustrate how we promoted parallel requests, improved cacheability, and minimized response sizes, all while staying true to the link- and form-driven spirit of hypermedia.</p>

    talk-title: Microservices&#58; gRPC or REST? Why not both?
    talk-abstract: <p>Building APIs for microservices can be a challenge. They have to be well designed, easily understandable, and highly performant. The tried and true platform for modern APIs is JSON/REST, but the ridiculous demands that a microservices architecture places on the network and API stack has made many of us look to new open source technologies such as HTTP/2, Protobuf, and gRPC. With features like bi-directional streaming and binary compression, gRPC is an great choice for microservice deployments. However, migrating to new technologies can be a challenge, especially in a microservices world. They lack the robust tooling and ecosystems provided by JSON/REST, and the other microservices may depend on it, make moving to a pure gRPC implementation difficult.</p><p>In this talk, I'll show you how you can build a gRPC endpoint that can intelligently serve gRPC over HTTP/2 while simultaneously serving JSON/REST over HTTP/1.1 on the same port! Then, I'll walk through some benchmarks and best practices for deploying these microservices in a scalable way.</p>

    talk-title: Why Aren't We Testing APIs? Seriously. It Is Every Company's Dirty Little Secret.
    talk-abstract: <p>In 1991 desktop websites really blew up and 13 years later in 2004 an automated testing solution named Selenium was built. Mobile apps became huge with the iPhone in 2008, and only 4 years later in 2012 we had Appnium. APIs have been around for longer, but the tipping point was around 2009. Therefore, why is it six years later and there is no Selenium for APIs? Worse than that, why isn't this viewed as a bigger deal?!</p><p>I will discuss crazy stories from my life of API failures. Ever had an accounting team tell you there was no revenue for 24hrs, and that was because of a typo in the API? I have. Testing isn't fun but if you know the tools that are available, and know how significant an issue like an inaccurate API can be, then you will find the time to make it work. Let's laugh at some failures, realize how easy the fixes could be, and finally make API testing part of continuous integration testing.</p>

    talk-title: The Death of Data
    talk-abstract: <p>Hoarding is only really painful when we run out of space. In a world with very cheap data storage, it never occurs to us that we should be getting rid of data instead of just storing it in giant silos. I'll explain why we are storing increasingly dangerous poison in our databases, and why we ought to care about automated de-acquisition and deletion. Data gets senile. It forgets its links, it only wants to tell you about the old days. Wikis overgrow like the thorns around Sleeping Beauty's castle, and reference manuals accrete into sedimentary layers. APIs gather and leak data like municipal water systems Even with search, we can't find what we're looking for. Too much data is as bad or worse than no data. We are building giant predictive structures on big data, but we are not evaluating the age or value of that data. Have you ever been boggled by your credit report? We are building thousands of reports like that with no consideration for the quality of the data we are using. This talk is not about data in the abstract, it's about ergot poisoning and hoarding and konmari and bitrot. When and why to kill your precious data, why data is a double-edged sword.</p>

    talk-title: How to talk about APIs
    talk-abstract: <p>One of the more challenging aspects of working with APIs is that outside of your own little tech bubble, nobody actually knows what an API is &ndash; despite being hopelessly dependent on APIs for their day to day lives. So how do you talk about APIs to the masses of people who have no idea what they are? You're going to have to do it &ndash; you'll need to talk to your non-technical colleagues about it, many of whom you're entirely dependent upon to improve your API or get it out to the masses; there'll be potential customers out there for whom your API is the exact solution to the problem they're having and there's the people you meet who ask you what it is you do.</p><p>In this talk we'll discuss how overcome this huge challenge for all of us in the business of APIs, how to establish not just a clear ubiquitous language when talking about our APIs but clarity and consistency of content - making sure your developers, salespeople, support and marketing are all talking about your APIs in a way that is accessible, meaningful and useful to all concerned, and how that consistency of understanding can be the difference between the success or failure of your API.</p>

    talk-title: Reverse Engineering Undocumented APIs with mitmproxy
    talk-abstract: <p>mitmproxy (<a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">https://mitmproxy.org/</a>) is a popular tool for observing HTTP(S) traffic between client applications and their API services by acting as a "man in the middle". The resulting service calls and their payloads can then be extracted and used in other applications and scripts. It also enables savvy users to hold apps accountable for how they transmit a user's private data. Popular apps such as Snapchat have had their APIs reverse engineered in this way, enabling user behavior that is unexpected (and sometimes undesirable) for app publishers. Another example is the small but growing open source community focused on studying the Robinhood stock brokerage app and its undocumented API that, as of this writing, remains open &ndash; enabling developers to experiment with $0 commission stock trading scripts.</p><p>This presentation will show how to set up mitmproxy on a workstation, connect a second device, and log otherwise secure HTTPS traffic &ndash; capturing the underlying API calls to understand the functioning of undocumented 3rd-party APIs. We will also explore what this means for API publishers, app developers, and users concerned about their digital security.</p>

    talk-title: Your Documentation Is Your UX
    talk-abstract: <p>As APIs are becoming more widespread and used by an increasing number of people from non-technical backgrounds, documentation needs to evolve. When trying to use an API instead of consulting a long website with just paragraphs of text, documentation will need to be more tailored to the reader. How technical a user is, which technologies they are using to interact with an API, and how much they've used it in the past should all affect the documentation they are viewing. Being able to include API keys in code samples, adjust examples based on if a user is using Ruby, Node, etc. and showing relevant documentation after they encounter an error are all examples of how documentation can adapt to provide the most utility. Documentation is the user experience for the API, so it needs to be a first class citizen.</p>

    talk-title: Who's on first for API security &ndash; User identity, Application Identity Or Device Identity? And how are they related?
    talk-abstract: <p>What role do standards such as OAUTH/OIDC play today/should play in the future for API security? Could properly implemented API security have prevented some of the recent breaches? With the explosive number of applications (especially mobile) we use everyday, many such apps access services using APIs. Therefore, streamlining API security protection is a critical matter. Standards such as OAUTH/OIDC are a key component of an interesting new paradigm in API security.</p><p>In earlier implementations of API security, the "application's identity" was verified by the back-end service and used by that service to determine whether to process a request. The application would establish the identity of the user and device, using separate methods, and information about the user and devices they used typically stayed in the application tier. Now, taking advantage of the latest open protocols and security standards, organizations are leveraging application architectures that allow for the flow of "user, device &amp; application identity" information to flow to back-end systems as part of the API requests that move up and down various layers of an organization's services.</p><p>It's important to make sure that the "user identity" assurance and verification services leveraged by API calls are the same identity and access management services and infrastructure that is used for verifying the user's identity when they access services using non-API based solutions, such as web-based apps. In other words, It makes sense to avoid creating yet another silo, specific to API-based identity verification. The importance of combining user and application identity became evident in light of recent breaches, where hackers took advantage of inadequate API security. In many cases, the machine to machine protection was in place, the underlying transport was secure, and the applications used unique identities for identity verification. However, lack of adequate user identity assurance on top of the machine identity/application layer, knowing the API URL and impersonating a registered application, enabled hackers to take control of the solutions. The talk will delve deeper into the role OIDC/OAUTH play in improving API security.</p>

    talk-title: Breathing new life into legacy SOAP services
    talk-abstract: <p>The reality is that SOAP services are no longer cool.  Developers today want to integrate with APIs that are labelled REST.  They want descriptive URLs, JSON payloads and familiar HTTP status codes.  But many enterprises spent 10 years building SOAP services and many of those services are working just fine today.  Rewriting them would be a huge effort with the risk of minimal gain. The good news is that it is possible to give developers what they are looking for without a re-write.  You can take advantage of HTTP's layered architecture to put a façade in front of your SOAP services, re-use all your existing code, breathe new life into your service and still support the existing client applications that are happily sending SOAP messages.This talk will explore the process of transforming native HTTP requests into SOAP messages and back into native HTTP responses.  We will discuss which parts of the façading process can be automated and which parts require design decisions.  Finally we will explore what capabilities we gain with this new style of API, and what we lose, so that you can make an informed decision on the future of your SOAP services.</p>

    talk-abstract: <p>Since it was first introduced, the REST architectural style was plagued with a high degree of vagueness and a lot of ambiguity. The absence of a concrete reference implementation early on left it up to the most popular web APIs to establish themselves as the gold standard. To win the hearts and minds of every last web developer, the leading tech companies invested greatly in building RESTful APIs, and put tremendous resources behind evangelizing their own individual flavors of REST. Capital One is no exception to the rule. As counter-intuitive as it may seem to be for a financial institution of its caliber, and as challenging as it is being a player in an industry locked into archaic technology and restrained by regulations, Capital One is fully engaged in a company wide initiative to expose financial services through internal and public-facing APIs implemented in the latest and greatest open source technologies. This talk is about how Capital One does REST, where the stakes are much higher and the risks are well beyond giving customers the wrong turn-by-turn directions.</p>

    talk-title: Moving Toward a Modular Enterprise
    talk-abstract: <p>APIs are leading the way for today's mobile initiatives and generating new business models as a result of the API economy. This talk examines the recent move by enterprises toward unbundling business and technical capabilities into small, reusable microservices that can be used to compose new user experiences across a variety of devices. We will then look at how leading enterprises are transitioning from today's service-oriented architecture to move toward a more modular, composable enterprise. Finally, we will look at how the convergence of APIs, mobile, IoT, microservices, chatbots, and voice will fundamentally change the way we build software in the next 5-10 years.</p>

    talk-title: The Big Problem with the Big Picture
    talk-abstract: <p>APIs are BIG. Bigger than many of us, even those of us in the industry, may realize &ndash; in fact, the total number of public APIs has exploded from under 7,500 in 2012 to over 15,000 in 2015. Larger companies have larger API structures, with more dependencies and integrations than ever before, and that number is growing. Entire business models have formed around the APIs provided by some of the industry's heaviest hitters. Imagine app juggernauts like Uber or Waze functioning without Google Mapping technology, or the important relationship between Netflix and the underlying applications that power its video streaming &ndash; these applications are absolutely dependent on their underlying APIs. And, new applications dependent on public APIs crop up every single day.</p><p>With that scale come challenges like managing your public API in a way that will foster growth of dependent APIs, scaling up, maintaining your SLA, and allowing for the versatility of user created applications; your API may be used in ways you never envisioned. In this session, I'll address challenges like sandboxing at scale, aiding in end user integrations, and managing the infinite number of dependencies larger APIs may encounter.</p>

    talk-title: Markdown Syntax for Object Notation (MSON)
    talk-abstract: <p>MSON is a plain-text, human and machine readable, description format for describing data structures in common markup formats such as JSON, XML or YAML. The aim of this description format is to facilitate the discussion (and thus validation) of data structures. The format, being agnostic to the common markup formats, is well suited for resource &amp; representations and content negotiation scenarios. In addition, this format also offers (limited) serialization functionality. Similar to the original Markdown to HTML (markup) conversion, MSON enables conversion to other markup formats. This format is being developed by Apiary as a part of the API Blueprint syntax to provide a means for description and validation of HTTP payloads and DRY, media-type agnostic, resource descriptions and to simplify content-negotiation.</p>

    talk-title: Using Personal APIs in a University Setting
    talk-abstract: <p>The API economy is in full swing and numerous commercial entities are engaged in producing APIs as a way of extending their reach. But as more and more of life is intermediated by computers, individuals also benefit from providing a personal API that can be used by applications on equal footing with other APIs.</p><p>Brigham Young University is teaching students about digital autonomy so that they are better prepared to be lifelong learners. In addition to a Domain of One's Own project, we have also embarked on a program of giving each student a personal API. By making students responsible for their own data, we teach them that they can be active participants in the digital realm. In addition to profile information, the API is also a means of accessing the student's personal learning record system (LRS). Students grant university and other systems access to the resources in their API. The personal API provides the same features that other APIs have including API management and authorization. The personal API works in concert with BYU's University API to create a rich, permissioned data ecosystem for application developers inside and outside the university. This talk will discuss design principles, implementation decisions, initial projects, and our experience to date.</p>

    talk-title: The bot revolution and its consequences for APIs
    talk-abstract: <p>Chat bots are invading our daily life. For example, your company is using Slack for team collaboration, and have installed dedicated bot to automate scrum meetings. You can also directly request a Uber ride from Facebook Messenger talking to a robot.Most of the chat and messaging applications have now open APIs to build chat bots on their system. Slack itself just launched an “app directory” and have put $80M aside to invest in the bot business. Those applications come create new interface which imply new way of consuming API.How could you be part of the bot revolution as a company? How should you change your API to make it more bot-ready? Which tools you should use? In this talk we will cover the different aspects of bot building using APIs, the recommended tools as well as best practices for API designers.</p>

    talk-title: Standardizing realtime API design
    talk-abstract: <p>Over the past few years, we've observed that realtime APIs are often difficult to consume due to the lack of client libraries. In fact, many API providers do not produce client libraries at all. This may be fine for conventional REST APIs, but it often presents a usability problem with APIs that push data. We think the consumption of realtime APIs ought to be made easier, on par with frameworks like Firebase or Meteor (or at least as close as we can get). In order to achieve this, we need to define baseline standards that make it possible to create common client libraries. This talk introduces LiveResource, an open protocol that API providers can use to make the content of RESTful resources synchronizable, and to make this capability discoverable.</p>

    talk-title: Testing your APIs with Cucumber
    talk-abstract: <p>BDD with Cucumber is gaining in popularity as it allows the expression of requirements using a custom domain-specific language that can be executed as tests to validate actual implementations. APIs in particular seem to have a lot to gain from this approach as they are often technical in nature; it seems that a correctly performed Cucumber implementation should allow increasingly non-technical stakeholders to participate in defining the requirements for an APIs behaviour and functionality.</p><p>But how "non-technical" can cucumber vocabularies be made to describe something as inherently technical as APIs? When does it make sense to use imperative vs declarative approaches? How do you translate simple language to complex payloads and validations? How does the usage of Cucumber scale as the complexity of an API increases? And how can standards like Swagger make cucumber testing even more intuitive? I know you're dying to find out - so don't miss this opportunity to adopt the path of API Gherkin Nirvana!</p>

    talk-abstract: <p>One of the major facets of API Evangelism is teaching users how to use APIs, whether specific to a company or as a general class. Unfortunately, when giving these workshops it's frequently difficult to create a consistent experience across different systems and platforms, especially when working with developers who have systems locked down by their IT departments. I've developed several different strategies for making disparate systems work smoothly so the workshop isn't bogged down with deployment issues. Strategies covered will include:</p><ul><li>Providing workshop code in multiple different languages, clear and simple goals</li><li>Deploying via a Docker container</li><li>Remote login to a system which can run Docker</li><li>Support from web resources such as the developer portal or a workshop guide</li> </ul><p>Making assumptions about what technology will work for your attendees can easily lead to a frustrating experience for your attendees.

    talk-title: How I got the CTO to pay for Open APIs
    talk-abstract: <p>Companies have been integrating their systems internally and externally via APIs for many years. APIs are not new, but the idea of them being openly accessible and available to be discovered by someone without your permission is indeed new for companies. Our company had dealt with integrating with partners for over 20 years, but these were necessary due to customer demand, not seen as an opportunity to increase our reach or revenue for that matter.</p><p>In order to convince C-level executives that there is an opportunity worth investing in, it is sometimes necessary to charge forward and create the outcome you need them to see. Using the experiences through this journey from integration to opportunity, this talk will explain how we achieved justification for an entire development team to be dedicated to deliver our future API strategy.</p>
