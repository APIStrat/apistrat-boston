      <p>API Strategy &amp; Practice takes the safety, comfort and inclusiveness of everyone involved in the event seriously. We require all attendees and staff to adhere to a code of conduct, in order ensure everyone is free from harrassment.</p>
     <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
     <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
     <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
     <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling the offender from the conference with no refund.</p>
     <p>If you are being harassed, or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they&#8217;ll be wearing branded t-shirts, are situated at registration counters, and also are usually monitoring each stage and audio station. You can <a title="Contact us" href="/contact/">contact us</a> with any reports, our email will be monitored in real-time during the event.</p>
     <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
     <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the conference, workshop, and conference-related social events. Let&#8217;s please all respect everyone, make everyone feel as comfortable as possible, making API Strategy &amp; Practice an all-inclusive conversation about APIs and how they are impacting the world around us.</p>
