<p>We are beginning a steady stream of announcements about keynotes for <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">APIStrat Austin 2015</a> over the next couple weeks, and we are excited about the lineup that we have planned. We have a handful of keynotes to announce this week alone, but one of the leaders in the first group we'd like to highlight is <a href="https://www.built.io/about/company">Neha Sampat, the CEO of Built.io</a>.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Neha has 15+ years experience in enterprise software, leading product marketing, cloud computing and online experiences for companies like Sun Microsystems and VMware. She co-founded KurbKarma, a TechCrunch Disrupt 2012 Startup Battlefield Finalist, and is an outspoken supporter of women entrepreneurs, appearing on multiple panels to talk about her role as a female tech leader &mdash; exactly the type of leader we look for in the API space.</p>
<p>With Built.io, Neha is leading the charge, taking the industry wisdom she has cultivated through building a mobile Backend-as-a-Service (mBaaS), and working day to day with companies to help them find success at the crossroads between mobile, web and the Internet of Things (IoT). APIs are not just for web and mobile anymore, and Built.io is helping Fortune 500 companies, and governments around the world to provide a new generation of realtime, engaging experiences at this critical intersection.</p>
<p>The forward-thinking conversations that Built.io and Neha Sampat are having with enterprises trying to design one step ahead of business and consumer and community demand, reflect the types of conversations we look to stimulate at APIStrat. We are honored to have her as part of the opening lineup in Austin this November.</p>
<p>Just a quick reminder, we only have a handful of sponsorship slots left, so <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/contact/">make sure you contact us now if iyou want to support the conversation in Austin</a>.</p>
