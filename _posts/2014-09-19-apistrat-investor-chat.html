<p>APIs are changing the way business is done, and startups are often at the forefront of that change. WeÂ’re lucky to have two experienced investors taking the stage at APIStrat for the Investor Fireside chat to dig down into how startups can leverage APIs to disrupt and how APIs affect their investment decisions.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Noah Doyle of Javelin Venture Partners:</strong> Noah is a partner at Javelin and was previously at Keyhole and Google where he saw first hand the impact of the Google Maps API. Javelin investments include AppFirst, Nexenta, Lithium and Famo.us so the firm is investing heavily in the Web Technology Economy.</li>
	<li><strong>Neill Occhiogrosso of CostanoaVC:</strong> Neill is the newest partner at Costanoa VC, a new West Coast VC that invests primarily in B2B SAAS companies including Demandbase, ReturnPath, Intacct, VictoOps and Risk.IO.
