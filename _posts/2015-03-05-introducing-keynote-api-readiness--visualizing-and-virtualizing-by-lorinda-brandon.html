In her APIDays/APIStrat keynote she will cover aspects and techniques to help you increase API understanding.</p>
<p>Whether your business relies on your API for revenue and brand awareness or your internal teams rely on it for their applications, it's important that your consumers can rely on your API. Even more important is making sure that your consumers can <em>understand</em> your API. From service descriptions to query tools, your API can be expressed to the outside world in many ways.</p>
<p>Lorinda will explore the various ways in which developers and business people can visualize the structure and capabilities of your API. Shell also talk about the value of mocking and virtualizing  how can you protect your API while also fostering innovation and experimentation?</p>
