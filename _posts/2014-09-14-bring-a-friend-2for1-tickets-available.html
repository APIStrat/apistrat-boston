<p>One of APIStrats main goals is to allow as many people as possible to benefit from the unique discussions, experiences, and insights shared through our conference series. In order for as many people as possible to join us for the 2014 U.S. edition in Chicago, we have a <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com/2014Chicago/register.php">2-for-1 ticket</a> deal for full conference passes, available through Friday.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Throughout our past events -- from San Francisco, to New York, to Amsterdam -- weve seen bringing API creators and consumers together catalyze conversations in exciting and important ways. This time, our theme of APIs Going Mainstream suggests an even greater need to bring together stakeholders from across the API ecosystem, as it extends to a broader audience.</p>
<p>We hope this 2-for-1 discount will allow and encourage more people from all corners of the sector to attend and to bring with them a fuller picture of the current state of APIs and where theyre headed.</p>
<p>We would love to see you there, too!</p>
<p>If you cant make it, well be <a href="http://www.apistrategyconference.com//2014Chicago/2014/09/12/live-streaming-the-main-stage/">live streaming</a> the main stage on the APIStrat website.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more exciting announcements and updates in the coming days, and help spread the word on Twitter with @apistrat and #apistrat.</p>
