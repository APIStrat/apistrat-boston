The team (which has grown), has deliberated for weeks now, working our way through the huge number of talks submissions we received, and are happy to finally have reached a version 1 draft for the schedule in Berlin, this April 24th and 25th, 2015.</p>
<p>Here is how the schedule breaks out for the API conversation on Friday, April 24th:</p>
<!--break-->
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breakout 1</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>API Design -</strong> One of the most important areas, impacting the API lifecycle in 2015learn from API thought leaders, about how they are using API design to change almost every stop along the API design lifecycle.</li>
	<li><strong>Financial Tech (FinTech) APIs -</strong> As the economy warms, banks, credit card companies, and market leaders are working to understand how APIs can provide the competitive advantage they are looking for, or potentially put them at a disadvantage if they dont take action.</li>
	<li><strong>Dev Track -</strong> The layer of API Days and APIStrat dedicated to developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Breakout 2</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Microservices &amp; Architecture -</strong> This is not your dads SOA, and micro service architecture is how enterprises are making the API shift, and learn the latest in Berlin.</li>
	<li><strong>Data &amp; Intelligence APIs -</strong> As with every other movement in the space, APIs are behind everything big data and business intelligence, and learn we are continuing the conversation about data &amp; intelligence during this session on day one.</li>
	<li><strong>Dev Track -</strong> The layer of API Days and APIStrat dedicated to developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Then on Saturday, April 25th, here is what s happening:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breakout 1</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hypermedia -</strong> This is a conversation you cannot miss in 2015. Hypermedia is not that fringe conversation amongst the API elite, it is something API providers across all sectors are implementing from Amazon to Paypal.</li>
	<li><strong>Building Right - Lessons From The Trenches -</strong> These stories have been part of the conversation since the first APIStrat in NYC 2013, and API Days Paris 2012, join us for the ongoing stories from the API trenches.</li>
	<li><strong>APIs &amp; Mobile -</strong> Mobile continues to be one of the biggest drives of API deployment, and we are focusing on what it takes to deliver the next generation apps in this session at API Days / APIStrat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Breakout 2</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>SpeedHack</strong> - The API Days / APIStrat kicks off, pushing all developers in a race to complete all the challenges.</li>
	<li><strong>API Infrastructure -</strong> Learn about what infrastructure is being used to deploy and manage leading APIs.</li>
	<li><strong>eCommerce -</strong> From gateways and Linux to Docker and AWS, learn about the API driven technology driving the API economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>
<div><strong>Breakout 3</strong></div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>SpeedHack</strong> - The API Days / APIStrat kicks off, pushing all developers in a race to complete all the challenges.</li>
	<li><strong>Internet of Things (IOT) -</strong> Lets talk about the fastest growing area of API growth in 2015, and learn about the latest views on API driven objects, being applied across the consumer, business, and industrial landscape..</li>
	<li><strong>Enterprise &amp; Enterprise Experience -</strong> Learn from some of the largest enterprises  about how they are becoming more agile and efficient and able to compete the API economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The current schedule represents 15 separate sessions at API Days / APIStrat, April 24th and 25th, 2015 in Berlin, Germany. Next up well showcase the companies, and speakers, that make up the API conversation in Berlin this spring. It was tough to choose which talks would be accepted, and which ones we had to say no--we hope the current mix represents the conversation the community is looking for, based upon previous talks in Paris, NYC, San Francisco, Amsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona and Chicago.</p>
<p>Our goal was to balance the needs of people just learning about the space, stay in tune with fast moving conversations like API design, and hypermedia, while also addressing the real-world conversations going on in the trenches at startups, and small, medium and enterprise level companies. Our goal is to strike a balance between where we have been, and where are going in the API space, with relevant talks for both business leaders, and developers.</p>
<p>We hope you're as excited as we are for the event. <strong>Remember to grab your tickets now, because the discounted early bird price is ending in just a few days on March 2nd. </strong></p>
