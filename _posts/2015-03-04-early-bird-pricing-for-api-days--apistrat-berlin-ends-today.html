<p><img class="alignright wp-image-530" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bw-bird.png" alt="bw-bird" width="250" height="250" />We are getting closer to the API conversation that is happening in Berlin, this April 24th and 25th. Early bird tickets get you into the conference for 299.00 euros, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saving you a 100 euro</span> if you purchase todaythe clock is ticking, so save money now.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">schedule is up</a>, and many of the <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/speakers/">speakers are posted</a>, so you have nothing holding you back from making your purchase decision. You only have a couple hours left, before we end the early bird, and move to the next stage of event pricing--you need to act now.</p>
<p>As with previous events, the API conference is going to be an intimate conversation between US and European experts in the API space, so make sure you do not miss out, and get you and your company <a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">registered today</a>.</p>
<p>We will see you Berlin!</p>
