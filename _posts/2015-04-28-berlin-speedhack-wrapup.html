We had a lot of fun!</p>
<p>We had lined up a great selection of sponsors to offer hackers nice challenges to solve. In only 3 hours hackers had to solve 9 API challenges on a variety of subjects. With about 40 contestants and despite the great weather of this Saturday afternoon in Berlin, we are sure everybody had fun.</p>

<p>Wifi issues gave some time to hackers to relax between coding session and play nerf battle. In fact, apart from coding there was also a lot of <a title="nerf guns" href="http://www.unbelievab.ly/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Wow._just_wow.jpg" target="_blank">nerf gun</a> shooting going on. The venue suddenlty was transformed into a war zone with people firing at each other having a great laugh.</p>
<p>At the end of the 3 hours time frame, we had 14 teams that have solved at least one challenge. The top three winning teams are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Ben and Max </strong>(EUR 1500.- in cash + a lot of additional swag from the sponsors)</li>
	<li><strong>MansillaDev </strong>(EUR 250.- in cash + a lot of additional swag from the sponsors)</li>
	<li><strong>API Scouts </strong>(EUR 150.- in cash + a lot of additional swag from the sponsors)</li>
</ol>
<p>Congrats to the winners.</p>
