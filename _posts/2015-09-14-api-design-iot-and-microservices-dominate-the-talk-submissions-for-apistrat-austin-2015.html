<p>We closed the call for papers for <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">APIStrat Austin 2015</a> last week, and have been processing the almost 100 talks that were submitted. We already had some session topics identified for the API conference this November 18th, 19th, and 20th in Austin, TX, but were also delighted to see the vast number of topics submitted through the call for papers process, resulting in this tag cloud.</p>

<p>This edition of APIStrat doesn't have a theme--we are just making about the roots of the conference, and looking to focus the conversation around the most pressing issues we face across the space at the end of 2015--I think this tag cloud reflects that conversation.</p>
<p>We have gone through all the talks, grouped them by topic, and will be reviewing them with the session chairs we have assigned to help organize and manage each track. By October, we will begin publishing the calendar, and sharing more detail about each session track, and the speakers in attendance.</p>
<p>While call for papers is closed, we have a handful of sponsorship opportunities left, <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/contact/">so contact us if you want to help support the conversation at APIStrat</a>. At the very least, <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/registration/">make sure you are registered before the very intimate event sells out,</a> you won't want to miss the conversations that occur.</p>
