<p><a href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Coca-Cola_Pascal-Morgan_Portrait3.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-603" src="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Coca-Cola_Pascal-Morgan_Portrait3.jpg" alt="Pascal Morgan, Coca-Cola" width="220" height="320" /></a><a href="http://www.coca-cola-deutschland.de/coke-war-immer-schon-ein-teil-meines-lebens">Pascal Morgan</a> is currently IT Director Germany &amp; IT Innovation Europe at The Coca-Cola Company where he is responsible for identification, prioritization, and delivery of German and European IT initiatives.</p>
<p>In his talk at APIDays/APIStrat Pascal will give a very exciting perspective on the challenges food &amp; beverages companies face with increasing complexity of regulations towards openness and transparency. He will present a concrete use case where The Coca-Cola Company used APIs exactly to tackle one of these challenges.</p>
<p>His talk about Why APIs at Coca-Cola? will discuss that in a world of rules and regulations, of liabilities and dependencies - and transparency towards consumers - the need of standardizing, adapting, and modularizing information has arrived even in the space of food &amp; beverages. The digital transformation is not always a question of Marketing, but also a challenge for backend systems and infrastructure. Pascal will discuss how European business regulations impact local system landscapes of Coca-Cola and how we solve some pertinent challenges - with APIs.</p>
<p>Here is more info about Pascal:</p>
