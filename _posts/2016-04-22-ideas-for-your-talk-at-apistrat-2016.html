<p>Our <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/call-for-talks/">call for talks</a> to speak at APIStrat 2016 is currently open. Submissions are being accepted until May 20.</p>
<p>We invite you to share your latest experiences and learnings when implementing API strategies, designing APIs, building out a developer community, and using technology to manage all stages of the API lifecycle.</p>
<p>At APIStrat, we have a reputation for creating a dynamic, forward-thinking program that balances a discussion of current trends with talks that forge new directions for us all to consider. </p>

<p>“The Program Committee will be reviewing submissions across all API topics, but we are particularly looking for four types of presentations”, says our 2016 Program Chair, Lorinda Brandon.</p>
<ol>
<li>1. “We’re looking to highlight some of the <strong>cutting edge technologies</strong> developers are already working with: new frameworks, innovations and tooling that is at the forefront of how we are all going to be doing our work in the future.</li>

<li>2. “We’re looking for the <strong>real world experiences</strong>, not the untested ideas: we want to hear the implementation stories — both the successes and failures that we can all learn from — within enterprise, fintech, health, government and across all industries.</li>

<li>3. “We’re looking for leaders to share their skills in <strong>managing APIs as products</strong>: the marketing, the evangelism, the documentation, and the business models.</li>

<li>4. “And finally, we are looking for the <strong>impact generators</strong>: the people out there who are using APIs without calling them APIs, the business innovators at all levels who are making use of new tools and processes to leverage APIs in their work without having to code.”</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cutting edge technology</h2>
<p>Last year, API description formats were finally given their recognition as the basic unit of value that enabled a single source of truth for an API, which has helped an API be communicated across business and developer teams. This year, we have seen the conversation move forward significantly with the availability of tools like API Transformer, StopLight (whose CEO and founder Marc McLeod spoke at APIStrat last year), Restlet Studio, and Run in Postman all being able to abstract the API definition file so you can choose your own description format and work with API design tools that bring more business and technical departments into the conversation. How are you using new API lifecycle technologies to bridge business and technology decisions and create value for your end customers and community of users?</p>
<p>Our Program Chair Lorinda Brandon says hypermedia, IoT and microservices are “table stakes” these days for an API conference. Last year’s microservices session was one of our most popular, for example, and pushed forward some of the key thinking around implementing new API technological approaches. How is 2016 pushing these areas further forward?</p>
<p>We are also looking for proposals that answer:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How is technology helping us build concise but powerful APIs? How do you manage the process of ensuring quality in your API design and delivery?</li>
	<li>How does documentation fit into great developer experience and what kind of tools are out there for describing, visualizing, and generating your API docs?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Real world experiences</h2>
<p>Two of the most shared APIStrat talks of 2015 were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylX3hUeYr-U">Loren Paulsen</a>’s practical look at how his team introduced APIs across a fintech business, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c_T7wOizoc">Teresa Tung</a>’s case studies sharing how APIs are influencing business model design in the Internet of Things. Other talks by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PblQbgz508">Dion Hinchcliffe</a> (on how APIs are fundamentally changing the enterprise) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbqrBasW1-k">Kristen Womack</a> (on how a product driven approach can help create more meaningful personas for developer outreach) lent heavily on real world examples to drop knowledge on the APIStrat audience.</p>
<p>“I’m also thinking about the things like API gateways, management platforms, and deployment architecture,” encourages Lorinda. “It would be great to hear from the companies who are struggling with finding the right solution, and the ones who outgrew their initial choice. What does this look like on the ground out there where you are living by the decisions you need to make for your company, government agency, non-profit or startup?”</p>
<h2>Productization of APIs</h2>
<p>“This is an upcoming area and people are struggling with how to do this,” shared Lorinda when setting the theme. Last year, there was a growing recognition of the need to “treat your API as a product” in order to create meaningful strategies and build out an API program within a larger organization. But the productization of an API needs a change of mindset, and a clear alignment with a business’ broader goals and directions. We held a new session stream focusing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm27lTuCM8M">API business models</a> and hosted sessions on both developer marketing and on evangelism last year, but maybe we also need a stream on API product management and more talks on platform business models to really help us wrap our head around what we mean when we talk about API as a product. What can you bring to our conversation?</p>
<h2>APIs for non-developers</h2>
<p>At APIStrat 2015 in Austin, we held a main stage panel looking at how API providers are reaching enabling non-developers to access the capabilities of an API through Google Sheets tools, widgets, integration services, and aggregator products. We were lucky to have Mark Geene, CEO of API integration platform <a href="cloud-elements.com">Cloud Elements</a> as one of our panelists. He is excited to see how this conversation continues in 2016.</p>
<p>“The first generation API management problem has been to help developers build APIs for other developers to consume,” Mark says. “Now, the next great challenge is to expand the consumption of APIs so average business users can make their apps work together. With 65% of integration tasks being developed outside of IT, APIs will need to be accessible to users who just want to make apps work together (but aren’t developers). New usage patterns include pre-built connectors integrated with your app and API, integration marketplaces that provide reusable integrations, and services such as IFTTT and others that provide integrations tooling for data transformation and workflow that can easily accommodate your API.”</p>
<p>We’d love to hear from businesses who are empowering non-developers to create solutions that draw on the power of APIs, and we would love to hear from individuals and community members who have use cases and examples of how they are consuming APIs and how they see this space as maturing in the future.</p>
<p>APIStrat is proud to have both a <a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> and a <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/2015/10/13/apistrat-an-inclusive-conversation/">Diversity Statement</a> in place so that we are actively encouraging and listening to a broad variety of perspectives from across our diverse community. Please contact us if you are a first time speaker or would like to brainstorm your idea for a talk so that it reaches the wide audience of APIStrat participants and reflects your unique voice. Please contact us via our online form and we will match you with a Program Committee mentor to help you prepare your proposal.</p>
