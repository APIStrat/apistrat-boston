<p class="p1">Attendees are deep in workshops on the first day if this years APIStrat and its going to be an awesome event! So many great speakers, sponsors and attendees talking APIs. After the fourth event were stoked at the community support and the great conversations that happen, so were happy to announce first of all the next APIStrat in Europe which will be in held in Berlin, Germany in late April or early May - dates to follow!</p>
<p class="p1">Secondly, were also announcing a community call for input on where to host next years fall APIStrat 2015! Weve had loads of location suggestions and wed love to figure out the places people would really like the next event run! So were requesting proposals and ideas on where to go + thoughts on how to make it awesome in that city. All we need is an email to <a href="mailto:apiconference@3scale.net"><span class="s1">apiconference@3scale.net</span></a> entitled APIStrat 2015 letting us know:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The location youd like to see the event in!</li>
	<li>Some info on the strength of the local API community.</li>
	<li>Suggestions of local folks who could help us organize on the ground.</li>
	<li>Suggestions of great venues [for around 500 people or up to 1000], with great space to hang out and work/chat.</li>
	<li>Any notable dates of local events to hook up with in the Oct/Nov timeframe.</li>
	<li>Any great local notable speakers we should consider!</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">All this would help a huge amount so if youd like to see APIStrat close to you next year speak up and let us know - email us by the 21st of October this year! Its not a formal bid and youre not making any commitments but it would be great to get thoughts and interest!</p>
<p class="p2">Looking forward to an awesome event!</p>
