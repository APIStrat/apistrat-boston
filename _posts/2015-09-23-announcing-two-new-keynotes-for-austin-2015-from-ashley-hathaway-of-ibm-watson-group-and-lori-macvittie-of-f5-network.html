<p>We are pleased to announce two new keynotes for APIStrat Austin 2015. We have been looking for new keynotes that reflect the growing conversations going on across the API space, we feel these two keynote speakers represent this mission.</p>
<p>APIStrat is always looking for honest stories from the people who are in the trenches at leading companies, and as we were looking through call for papers submissions, we though Ashley's story stood out. We are please to invite her to the main stage for Austin.</p>
