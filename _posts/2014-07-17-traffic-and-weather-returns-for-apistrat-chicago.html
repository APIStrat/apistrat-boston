<p>They are back! The geeky, highly critical, and hilariously funny duo, John Sheehan (<a href="https://twitter.com/johnsheehan">@johnsheehan</a>) and Steve Marx (<a href="https://twitter.com/smarx">@smarx</a>), of <a href="http://trafficandweather.io">Traffic and Weather</a> are coming Chiago. If you aren't familiar with the hilariously informative podcast, that is Traffic and Weather, I highly recommend heading over to <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/">TrafficandWeather.io</a>, and give  a listen.</p>
<p>While you are there, listen to <a href="http://trafficandweather.io/posts/2013/11/4/episode-19-consistently-available-pizza-live-from-api-strategy-and-practice">Episode 19: Consistently Available Pizza (Live from API Strategy and Practice)</a>. At #APIStrat San Francisco, Sheehan and Marx entertained the main stage audience, with their hilarious API fueled podcast antics--live!</p>
<p>You can also find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJmqfM2r07Y">video of the show</a>, over at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/apistrat">#APIStrat Youtube channel</a>, which will give you a small taste of what is to come in Chicago. We are excited to have Traffic &amp; Weather back, helping us poke fun at the sometimes crazy world of APIs, while also make sense of some very technical topics, in a very hilarious and entertaining way.</p>
