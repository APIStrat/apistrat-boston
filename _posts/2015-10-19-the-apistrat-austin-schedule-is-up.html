<p>The <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">schedule for APIStrat Austin</a> has taken a little longer than expected this round, with the events team having to making some very hard decisions about which talks are accepted, and saying no to some amazing talks and speakers. We have also been working overtime to bring up our diversity numbers, sticking to our mission to make the leading community API event as inclusive as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to the numerous keynotes, panels, and fireside chats (which we will cover in later posts), we've broken out the talks we've received into the following session tracks:</p>
<!--break-->
<ul>
<li>API Design</li>
<li>Internet of Things</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>API Definitions</li>
<li>API Testing &amp; Monitoring</li>
<li>Internal Innovation</li>
<li>Hypermedia&nbsp;</li>
<li>Dev Experience</li>
<li>Microservices</li>
<li>Business Models</li>
<li>Post HTTP</li>
<li>API Discovery</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/schedule/">Thank you for your patience while we worked to make the schedule the best we can</a>. We are now 30 days away from APIStrat in Austin, <a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/registration/">so make sure you get registered</a>, as we've already sold almost 1/3 of the tickets before the schedule was even published.</p>
<p>We also have a single gold sponsorship left, and a handful of bronze sponsorship's available if you would like to help support the conversation--<a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/contact/">please contact us for a copy of the sponsorship prospectus, or with any other questions you may have</a>.</p>
<p>We'll see you in Austin, TX next month!</p>
