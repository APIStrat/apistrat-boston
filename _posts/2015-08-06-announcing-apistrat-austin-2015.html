<p>It is time for the next APIStrat experience, and after an exciting, sold out APIDays Berlin &amp; APIStrat Europe 2015 in Berlin, we are moving the conversation to Austin, Texas. </a><a href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/">We are pleased to officially announce APIStrat Austin 2015, at the Sheraton Austin Hotel At The Capitol, this November 18th, 19th, and 20th 2015</a><a>.</a></p>
<!--break-->
<p>For the sixth edition of APIStrat, we are keeping to our roots, with a three day conversation focused on the opportunities, and challenges faced by API providers today. The event will bring together API experts, practitioners, developers, and business folk, to share their stories from their API experience--no special theme, just the important conversations around what is impacting the space in 2015.</p>
<p>Over the next couple weeks we will open up the call for papers, share the topics for some of the session tracks, and some of the other ideas we have planned for this edition of APIStrat. We are extremely excited at the amount of enthusiasm we have on the ground in Austin, which is one of the major reasons we chose the city--we look forward to making this a uniquely Austin API conversation.</p>
<p>APIStrat Austin is going to be an close conversation maxing out at 400 people, so make sure you get involved early. Contact us if you are interested in sponsoring, or supporting in any way, and make sure your company is part of the conversation.</p>
<p>The APIStrat team looks forward to seeing you in Austin!</p>
