			<p>Thanks to the guidance of our 2016 Program Chair Lorinda Brandon, we have some ground-breaking and envelope-pushing presentations lined up for you. (Can you break ground and push envelopes at the same time? We certainly aim to!)</p>
			
			<p>Last year, one of the themes that emerged from our talks was the idea that API program growth is best enabled by treating the API itself as a product. This year, we dive deeper on this topic with a full session block on <span style="font-weight:400;">Product Management</span>.</p>
			<!--break-->
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/melissa_jurkoic">Melissa Jurkoic</a> from <a href="http://developer.newmarketinc.com/">Newmarket</a>, will share her successes on <em>How I got the CTO to pay for Open APIs</em>. While Newmarket had dealt with integrating with partners for over 20 years, these were necessary due to customer demand, and not seen as an opportunity to increase the company's reach or revenue. Melissa will explain how she helped achieve justification for an entire development team to be dedicated to deliver their API strategy.</li>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/richiegjones">Richard Jones</a> from Dun &amp; Bradstreet will talk about how using APIs allows companies to innovate on already market tested products and allow them move it into an entirely new market segments to drive innovation and growth.</li> 
				<li>Jon Spinney from <a href="http://developer.pitneybowes.com/">Pitney Bowes</a> will go back to the the three Ps for <em>API Product Management: People, Price, and Product - In That Order</em>. He will argue why, when designing a new commercial API offering, People come first, Price comes second, and the Product third, and explain why, when approached this way, it can inform your decisions for business support systems needed to support a self-service developer offering with variable pricing, unified currency, unified contracting, and unified billing.</li>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/harmophone">Tyler Singletary</a> from Lithium Technologies (makers of Klout) will play devilâ€™s advocate with his wisdom on <em>How To Kill Your API Program</em>, walking through the simple steps to kill your API program, and, without as much irony, discuss the reasons you might actually want to do just that.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span style="font-weight:400;">API Design and Governance</span> is a key best practice stream at every API Strategy and Practice. This year talks will include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/mamund">Mike Amundsen</a> will lead us with <em>Taking Advantage of the Web API Design Maturity Model</em> sharing valuable lessons from a Web API Design Maturity Model (WADM). His talk outlines four WADM levels, talks about the strengths and challenges of each design paradigm and how API designers and implementers can move from one level to the next when needed.</li>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/mbernier">Matt Bernier</a> will balance <em>The Desire for Perfection vs. Reality</em>, sharing the ways he has found to innovate within reality and selectively choosing concessions in order to provide better features and functionality to customers with a relatively small team.</li>
				<li>Amanda Whaley and Ashley Roach from <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp">Cisco DevNet</a> will explain <em>How to train your API &ndash; Experiences from the wilderness and back again</em>, where they some of the methods and practices they are using and some of the lessons learned from the from the battle tested Cisco DevNet team.</li>
				<li><a href="https://voxpop.co/">Matthew Reinbold</a> will speak on effective API governance and will explain what effective API governance looks like and the challenges in getting there. This will cover: The role of training and mentoring, building trust across siloed organizations, establishing meaningful metrics, and automation.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>One of the standout keynote panels last year focused on <span style="font-weight:400;">Consumption of APIs</span> and this year we again extend that theme with a whole session, including speakers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/devin_s">Devin Sevilla</a> on <em>How to be a courteous guest: providing SDKs to developers</em> which will introduce methods to earn the trust of developers and how to manage the fallout from the inevitable bug in your SDK.</li>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/POSoftware">Oliver Thamm</a> will talk about <em>API Accessibility: Key Concepts driving Developer Adoption</em>. He will ask How do API access methods influence developer adoption?</li>
				<li><a href="http://twitter.com/switzerly">Shelby Switzer</a> will share the connections between <em>APIs, Spreadsheets, and Drinking Fountains: Using Open Data in Real Life</em>. Shelby will draw on stories from communities across the US and the world, diving into what organizations are doing well, where they fall short, and what you can do about it. From the perspective of API providers and consumers alike, this talk presents key techniques for taking open data to the next level</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Other sessions include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span style="font-weight:400;">Hypermedia.</span> With talks by Pete Gamache on <em>Implementing Cross-protocol Hypermedia Services</em>; Gareth Jones comparing <em>Hypermedia vs Graphs: Best buddies or the next API battleground?</em>; Benjamin Greenberg from Comcast on <em>Using Hypermedia APIs to Drive Interactive Mobile Applications</em> and Irakli Nadareishvili will explain <em>Documenting Hypermedia APIs</em>.</li>
