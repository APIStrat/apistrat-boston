It is one of the fastest growing areas, reflects the most pressing issues that face API providers, and is poised to lead almost every other stop along the API lifecycle. When you think about API design, think the drummer in a rock band--API design will set the beat for everything  that happens, at every stage of an APIs life.</p>

<p>Your API design decision have the potential to affect every other aspect of API operations from testing and monitoring, to support and documentation. The best way to minimize mistakes along the way, and maximize API design success, is to learn from leading API design experts across the space, at intimate API focused events like API Days / APIStrat in Berlin this spring.</p>
<!--break-->

<p>Weve invited three experts from different areas of the API space:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Orlando Kalossakas</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/orliesaurus">@orliesaurus</a>) of <a title="Mashape" href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> - Designing and building APIs, creating great documentation, and mocking</li>
	<li><strong>David Garry</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/davidgarry6">@davidgarry6</a>) of <a title="Nomos Software" href="http://nomos-software.com/">Nomos Software</a> - Extending Swagger for Virtual and Diagnostic Rich APIs</li>
	<li><strong>Jason Harmon</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/jharmn">@jharmn</a>) from <a title="Paypal" href="https://developer.paypal.com/">Paypal</a> - Technology/Design or Best Practice (issues learned from running the Paypal program)</li>
</ul>
<p>We still have one slot available in our API design session, this doesn't mean we need to find someone, this means we have a couple of options, and are having a hard time deciding what would be the cherry on top of the API design discussion in Germany. Orlando, David, and J(a)son are bringing some serious experience to the table, and the fourth slot should bring it home.</p>

<p>When it comes to any aspect of the API economy, API design is the most critical layer that the entire API community should be working to share expertise, best practices, and stories from the trenches. If you are unsure of what the best practices are, you should be tuning into the conversation that happen at API Days / APIStrat.</p>

<p>Make sure and get <a title="API Days / APIStrat Registration" href="http://apidaysberlin2015.apistrat.com/#tile_registration">registered for the conference</a>, and we will see you in Berlin, April 24th and 25th, 2015.</p>
