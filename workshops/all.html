          <p><strong>Register for: API Speaker Workshop - Telling your Story with Kirsten Hunter</strong></p>
          <p>Welcome to API Strategy and Practice!  This session is designed to help new speakers (and experienced speakers as well) feel comfortable and confident during your presentation.  The idea of presenting at conferences is frequently daunting to non-speakers. When I got started giving talks, I was terrified of being called out on areas I wasn’t an expert in. I finally realized that there are different ways to present information.</p>

          <p><strong>Register for: A Modern API Lifecycle Workshop with Kin Lane</strong></p>
          <p>The API industry has significantly evolved since its early days, moving well beyond just deploying and managing APIs. Many API providers are getting sophisticated in how they approach everything from API design, to addressing monitoring, testing, and security. Join Kin Lane, the API Evangelist for a walk through the 30 most common areas top API providers are working on, across the entire lifecycle of their APIs. Bring your laptops, as this workshop will give you a wealth of resources you can explore across the modern API lifecycle.</p>

          <p><strong>Register for: Focus on API Workflow Workshop with Tony Tam</strong></p>
          <p>APIs are core to your business but are often treated more like artifacts of code rather than first class citizens in the development stack.  In this talk, we’ll focus on the API-First process with Swagger and how open-source tools can speed things up and can make a more cohesive process for the entire development team.</p>
