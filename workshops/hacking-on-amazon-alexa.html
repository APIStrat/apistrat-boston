		<h3>What is Alexa?</h3>
		<p>Alexa, the voice service that powers Amazon Echo, provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to interact with devices in a more intuitive way using voice. Examples of capabilities through the Alexa Voice Service include the ability to play music, answer general questions, set an alarm or timer, and more.</p>
		<p>The Alexa Skills Kit is a collection of self-service APIs, tools, documentation and code samples that make it fast and easy for you to add skills to Alexa.</p>
		<p>At this skill building bootcamp, Rob McCauley, Solutions Architect from the Alexa Skills Kit team will be onsite to help you add your own capabilities (skills) to Alexa.</p>
		
		<h3>Why You Should Learn to create Alexa Skills</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Once certified, your new skills will be published in the <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html" target="_blank">Alexa app</a> which will in and of itself be a great addition to your portfolio.</li>
			<li>Second, youâ€™ll gain experience with three services: Amazon's Alexa Skills Kit, AWS Lambda (part of Amazon Web Services), and the NodeJS backend JavaScript framework.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Who should attend?</h3>
		<p>This bootcamp is appropriate for developers and non-developers alike.</p>
		
		<h3>What should I do prior to arrival to ensure a better bootcamp experience?</h3>
		<p>Start off on the right foot with these prerequisites:</p>	
		<ul>
			<li>Sign up for an <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon developer account (free)</a></li>
			<li>Sign up for an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS account</a> (free - but CC required for signup)</li>
			<li>Download sample templates to your desktop <a href="https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js" target="_blank">here</a></li>
			<li>For the best experience, please bring a laptop, as a tablet does not provide the multi-tab capabilities you'll need.</li>
		</ul>
