          <p><i>Kirsten Hunter</i></p>
          <p>Welcome to API Strategy and Practice!  This session is designed to help new speakers (and experienced speakers as well) feel comfortable and confident during your presentation.  The idea of presenting at conferences is frequently daunting to non-speakers. When I got started giving talks, I was terrified of being called out on areas I wasnâ€™t an expert in. I finally realized that there are different ways to present information.</p>
