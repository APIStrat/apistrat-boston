          <h1>Register for: A Modern API Lifecycle Workshop</h1>
          <p><i>Kin Lane</i></p>
          <p>The API industry has significantly evolved since its early days, moving well beyond just deploying and managing APIs. Many API providers are getting sophisticated in how they approach everything from API design, to addressing monitoring, testing, and security. Join Kin Lane, the API Evangelist for a walk through the 30 most common areas top API providers are working on, across the entire lifecycle of their APIs. Bring your laptops, as this workshop will give you a wealth of resources you can explore across the modern API lifecycle.</p>
