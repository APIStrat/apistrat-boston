			<em>Keynote</em></p>
			<p>Empowering communities traditionally overlooked through code. We're heavily focused on the Native American communities in New Mexico (primarily the four corners area). Our mission for 2017 and beyond is to provide the same opportunities to areas like Yuma, AZ., Savannah, GA., El Centro, CA., and along with the various cities in NM that are suffering from high unemployment rates and lack of diversity in the technology job sector.</p>
