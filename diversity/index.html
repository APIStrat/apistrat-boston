      <p>To contribute to a thriving API economy, we need everybody. We believe that APIs can be a technological tool that can transform business, government and community. We believe APIs can create opportunities for everyone and can stimulate new models of business, including for those who have been underrepresented or excluded from participating fully in their communities, in business and in broader society.</p>
     <p>API Strategy and Practice believes that true innovation depends on the active participation of both speakers and participants with a variety of perspectives.</p>
     <p>We want our conference, and the technology communities and companies who participate in them, to include, encourage, and recognize people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, sexual orientation, and military service. We’re not there yet. We’re working to increase career opportunities in technology for people from underrepresented groups by actively recruiting diverse speakers for our events, offering scholarships and subsidies wherever possible, and taking part in ongoing conversations about the value of diversity in the communities we serve.</p>
     <p>Here are some ways you can help us build a more diverse community:</p>
     <ul><li>Read our <a title="Code of conduct" href="http://austin2015.apistrat.com/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a> for event participation and encourage your colleagues to read and share amongst those participating at API Strategy and Practice.</li>
     <li>Recommend appropriate speakers and/or program committee members to the conference chairs. Encourage your diverse networks to attend and actively participate.</li>
     <p>Forward our Call For Papers and Draft program to relevant groups you are in contact with and share that we are looking for a diverse roster of speakers and conference participants. (For example, you can send them a link to this Diversity Statement.)</li>
     <li>Suggest to potential speakers and leading API practitioners that they submit proposals or make plans to attend, or contact us via email at apiconference@3scale.net so that we can reach out directly.</li>
     <li>Encourage end users; API consumers; API newbies; training graduates; API developers; IT architects; product managers; developer evangelists; startup founders; business, community and government leaders; and other creators and community members to work with us, to share their experiences and insights in our blog and at our conferences, and/or recommend them to us directly by emailing apiconference@3scale.net</li>
     <li>Help us host API Strategy and Practice warm-up events leading up to the conference as practice and training events for first-time speakers and others wanting to test their new, innovative, forward-thinking content.</li>
     <li>Help us provide training resources and support for first-time speakers to develop their skills prior to their presentation through running workshops or providing mentoring support, email us at apiconference@3scale.net to volunteer.</li>
     <li>Suggest other ways that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and supportive: send an email to apiconference@3scale.net</li>
     <li>Let us know if you would like to apply for a diversity scholarship or travel subsidy to attend.</li>
     <li>Help us to reduce barriers to participation by sponsoring our conference diversity scholarships and subsidies program.</li>
<p>We value diversity in the communities we bring together, and we welcome your contributions to creating balanced representation of the richness of our collective human experience.</p>
<p>Please share your ideas and best practices for how we can realize our vision by sending an email to apiconference@3scale.net</p>
